# Asus USB Wifi


The wifi chip in ASUS USB N10 Nano (B1) is Realtek 8188EUS[^1] and it works on Linux 5.9, but not Linux 5.10 or later.

## Manjaro Wifi driver install

Both kernel header files and `dkms` are required to install DKMS drivers[^2]:

```bash
sudo pacman -S $(pacman -Qsq "^linux" | grep "^linux[0-9]*[-rt]*$" | awk '{print $1"-headers"}' ORS=' ')

sudo pacman -S bc dkms git base-devel
```

Install the driver from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/8188eu-dkms)

```bash
paru -S 8188eu-dkms
```

After installation:

```bash
# Block the default kernel module to use the new driver. This step is optional because the AUR package should do this for you.
echo 'blacklist 8188eu' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/8188eu-blacklist.conf

sudo depmod -a
sudo mkinitcpio -P

sudo reboot
```

If your WiFi is still not working properly, continue with the following steps[^3]:

1. Stop Network Manager
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
   ```
2. Load your module into the kernel
   ```bash
   MODULE=$(hwinfo --wlan | grep "Driver Activation Cmd" | cut -d " " -f9 | tr -d '"') && sudo modprobe $MODULE
   ```
3. Raise your Device (WiFi adapter)
   ```bash
   DEVICE=$(hwinfo --wlan | grep "Device File" | cut -d " " -f5) && sudo ip link set $DEVICE up
   ```
4. Ensure all network adapters are unblocked:
   ```bash
   sudo rfkill unblock all
   ```
5. Then restart network manager:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
   ```

You may try serveral things to increase your success rate:
- Fully shutdonw your computer, including unplug it for a while.
- Plug the WiFi dongle back into a different USB port.
- Boot into BIOS and disable any wired NIC, or reses to default settings.
- Use another working kernel. (I ended up this this solution)
